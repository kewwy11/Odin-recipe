        <h1>STEPS ON HOW TO PREPARE THIS MEAL</h1>
        <p>Rub the chicken thighs with salt and pepper and leave them in a bowl. Cut the onions into two and  chop one part into small pieces</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan and add the chicken one at a time. I like to use a wide skillet for this so I can do everything at the same time. Brown the chicken on each side for about 10 minutes each. When the chicken is done, take it out and leave it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, and the other half of the onion together. If possible do this without adding water, or adding just a little, so the flavors are more potent. Add the chopped onions to the olive oil and saut√© till translucent.</li>
            <li>Pour in the blended tomato and pepper mix and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add in the chicken thighs, chicken stock (broth), bouillon, curry, and thyme, and bring to a boil. Taste for salt and add more if you need to. Simmer for about 20 minutes or until the chicken is done.</li>
            <li>Your chicken stew is ready!! It can be eaten with boiled rice, macaroni and spaghetti</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Just like my <a href="part 2/beef stew recipe.html">beef stew recipe</a>, this chicken stew is bold and spicy and pairs very well with various dishes. In Nigeria, it is quite common to have a pot of beef or chicken stew in your fridge at any point in time.
            It makes meal prep a breeze and you can easily whip up a complete nutritious lunch or dinner in no time.</p>
