        <p>Nigerian Beef Stew is a mouthwatering West African stew made with blended tomatoes, red bell peppers, and habanero peppers and spiced to perfection. It is so versatile and is amazing with so many different dishes!</p>
        <p>Nigerian stew is by far the most popular dish in Nigeria and is traditionally eaten with rice or boiled yam. I make this every week and always have it in my fridge as it makes meal prep a breeze. It is definitely a staple in my Nigerian household!</p>
        <p>This beef stew is made with beef cuts, but you can change it up as you like. </p>

        <h1>How To Make This Recipe</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by preparing the beef. If not already pre-cut, cut the beef into bite-size pieces, wash and drain. Place in a pot and add enough water to cover it, then add salt </li>
            <li>You do not need to add a lot of spices here. You need just enough to bring out the flavor but remember spices will still be added to the stew. Let it cook for roughly 20-25 minutes. You can let it cook a bit longer if you want it more tender, or a bit shorter if you want it tougher.</li>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes, bell pepper, habanero pepper, and half of the onion in a food processor. Chop the other half onion and set it aside.</li>
            <li>When the beef is ready, drain it out from the stock, but save the stock. We’ll still need it later to add flavor to the stew</li>
            <li>Add olive oil to a large pot. When heated, add the chopped onions and stir until it just begins to wilt. Pour in the tomato mixture, add black pepper, and stir. I don’t add other spices just yet because I will be adding the stock later on, and I don’t want to run the risk of the stew being too salty. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add in the beef and some of the stock. I add half a cup of stock first and possibly add a little more if I need to. Add the thyme, bouillon powder, and curry. Taste for salt before adding any.</li>
            <li>Cover and let simmer for 10 minutes on medium-high heat. Your beef stew is ready to eat!</li>
            </ul>
